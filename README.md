 Queuing Model 
 
 Queuing theory is the mathematical analysis of waiting lines, or queues. A queuing model is built such that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted. Queuing theory is usually considered a branch of operations science, as the findings are mostly used when making business decisions about the resources required to provide a service.
 
 M/M/1 Queue:
In queuing theory, a discipline within the mathematical probability theory, an M / M/1 queue represents the queue length in a system with a single server, where the arrivals are calculated by a Poisson method, and there is an exponential distribution of work service times. The standard name is written in the notation of Kendall.By several metrics of interest in this model, the model is the most basic of queuing models and an appealing object of analysis as closed-form expressions can be obtained. An extension of this model is the M/M/c queue, with more than one application.
